Basic Rules
===========

Dice System
-----------
CCARPS is a d6 system that utilizes five six-sided dice throughout the game. A player rolls a number of dice between two and five in an attempt to roll the lowest possible score. Success tests are based on the two lowest dice in any given roll. Success rolls are required for Perception checks, Combat actions ( Attack, Parry, Block, and Dodge), Skill tests, and Attribute tests.

###Critical Rolls
Critical success is any roll where all the dice roll a 1, a critical failure is any roll where all the dice roll a 6. On any critical roll a player character will draw a chance card.

Chance Cards
------------
Chance cards are used to create interesting role-play opportunities. During play when a character rolls a critical failure a chance card would be given to the player, chance cards can have positive and negative effects. Typically each card would have a success option and a failure option. Another example is the .Plot Twist. card which generally follows the existing plot but throws in a clue or a bit of disinformation or an odd requirement like .this situation must be solved with an explosion.. Most often the GM will put these together as the adventure is being built so that they will fit with the adventure.
