CCARPS
======

What is it?
-----------

An open source / creative commons licensed resource for
table-top / pen-and-paper role playing that is legal to
be included in it.s original form and/or in modified form,
such that the modifications are shared back to the
community, in derivative products made and distributed
for fun and/or profit.

Philosophy
----------

It is our belief that role playing systems should be free
from restriction in use and manner of play. Role playing
is a community event that requires community action so it
is our intention to create, collect, and maintain the
rules in a fashion consistent with the needs and desires
of the community that uses it.

The goal for the Creative Commons Adaptive Role Play
System is to provide an open framework for building
role-playing games. As such, the rules here will be
rather sparse . it is a framework in which you can build
your own system, to cater to the style of game you want
to play. The key difference between CCARPS and other role
play systems is the license. Our intent is to create a
role play system that is owned and maintained by the
community that uses it. Therefore, we want you to understand
that any contributions made to the system will become the
property of the community. We expect citizens of the CCARPS
community to conduct themselves in a respectful manner.
